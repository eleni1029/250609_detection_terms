# 這個文件的用途是在同一個語系、同一個 msgid 之下，想要給不同環境有不同的翻譯所使用的文件
# 此文件是給 tp-doe 環境使用，如果你需要為其它環境客製不同的翻譯，你應該要再產生一個新的 pot 文件，然後修改 i18n.gettext2
# 來取用新翻譯
# 如果你要給指定環境、指定org客製翻譯，建議文件命名為 message_deliveryorg_orgid.pot
# 如果你不需要客製翻譯，你只需要在 messages.pot 建立平台通用的翻譯即可
# Usage:
# 在 html 上仍使用 _ ，在 py 需改用 from lms.i18n import gettext2 as _ 取代 from
# flask_babel import _
